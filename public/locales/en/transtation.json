    "description": "I am a web developer with a deep understanding of modern technologies such as Vue.js, React, Nuxt.js, HTML, and CSS. My experience allows me to create interactive, productive, and responsive web applications that meet industry best practices. I also have a sense of design and know how to work with tools such as Figma and Adobe XD, which helps me develop interfaces that combine visual appeal and usability. I am able to effectively interact with designers and, if necessary, independently develop UI layouts adapted to the needs of the project."
